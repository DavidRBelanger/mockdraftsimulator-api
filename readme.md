# nflprospectsapi

## Overview
This API provides endpoints to access basic American Football college -> NFL prospect information. API keys can be retrieved (for limited, personal project use only) by contacting 'dbelanger@albany.edu' or visiting my website (davidrbelanger.dev) and contacting me through there.

This api is hosted through netlify, and hosted through Google Firebase's free tier, so access is limited. 

## Base URL
```
/https://nflprospectsapi.netlify.app/api/v1/
```

## Authentication
All endpoints require an API key to be provided in the request headers. The API key should be included as follows:
```
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
